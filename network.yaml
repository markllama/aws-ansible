#
# This playbook establishes a network with public IP addresses and an internet gateway
# This allows direct access to the instances from the internet.
#
# A VPC contains a collection of subnets and the components that connect them to each other
# and to other networks including The Internet(tm).
#
# A Subnet is a network space, bounded by a CIDR network address. Devices holding addresses
# within this space can all communicate directly. The physical analog is a broadcast domain
#
# An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a connector that bridges a VPC to the internet
# It has an IP address within the VPC.  Traffic destined for the internet must be
# routed to the IGW IP address.
#
# A route table is what it sounds like: A list of IP route entries that define how
# traffic destined for addresses outside the current CIDR space should be forwarded.
#
# A Security Group defines a set of IP (TCP/UDP) ports that are allowed inbound and outbound
# from an instance. A security group is applied to an instance and acts as a form of external
# firewall for the instance.
#
# Each object as it is created is identified by a unique ID string. The AWS Ansible modules
# return a data structure that represents the object and incudes the object ID.
# The ID can be recorded and used for later operations
